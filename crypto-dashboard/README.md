# Real-Time Cryptocurrency Dashboard

The Real-Time Cryptocurrency Dashboard is a responsive web application built with React, Redux, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to view real-time and historical data of cryptocurrencies, including their price, market cap, total supply, and more. The dashboard also provides interactive features like filtering, searching, and seamless navigation between multiple pages (Dashboard, Overview, and History).

This project integrates the CoinCap API to fetch data for selected cryptocurrencies and visualize it using charts and tables. The app's goal is to provide an intuitive and interactive experience for crypto enthusiasts and developers to explore cryptocurrency data.
